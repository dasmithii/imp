BRANCH (cleanup):

 + Move runtime->root to importer field.

 + Instead of Runtime_cloneField, reference builtins statically
   with Runtime_getBaseNumber, Runtime_getNumber, and et cetera.

 + Make root_scope fields true and false.



NOW:

 + Make address type

 + Make legit ':' operator.

 + Form iterator idioms

 + Add (implements x y) function for interface checking.

 + Fix hashmap.

 + Make regex module

 + Make Go-inspired defer

 + Make break and continue accept arguments to deal with
   nested loops.

 + Protect against circular prototype linkage.




MAJOR:

 + Design and implement standard library.

 + Consolidate memory using a hybrid free list instead of
   fragmented malloc calls all over the place. Capitalize
   on repeat object sizes.




MEDIUM:

 + Handle exception catch cleanups.
 
 + Replace slot system with legit accessor.

 + Implement macros




MINOR:

 + Improve internal module code scanner. Use regex
   or something.




MAYBE:
 
 + Make carrots variable expansion operators.

 + Prototype multiplexing (multiple inheritance).




LATER:
  + Concurrency!!!
