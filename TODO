TODAY:

 1. Make C module loader

 2. Implement exception try/catch with callback functions.
    - Use (try {<code>}, )

 3. Improve error reporting.


SERIALIZE LIBRARY LOADS


MAYBE:
 
 + make carrots variable expansion operators

 + give objects reference count fields (instead of slots)



AT SOME POINT:

 + Make it so blocks with one statement don't need parens

 + Implement vector slicing

 + TODO: check return codes on builtin calls

 + Make number and string methods search for toNumber and
   toString methods instead of rejecting other types.

 + Make printer look for toString methods.
 
 + Replace slot system with legit accessor.

 + Check for mismatched grouping operators and such

 + Finish builtins: (1) hashmap

 + Exception catching



 WAY LATER

  + Concurrency!!!
