MAJOR:
 + Design and implement standard library.




MEDIUM:

 + Handle exception catch cleanups.
 
 + Replace slot system with legit accessor.




MINOR:

 + Make it so dlclose is called by module context
   destructors. This is not critical because library 
   loads are inexpensive and can be left unclosed.

 + Improve internal module code scanner. Use regex
   or something.



MAYBE:
 
 + Make carrots variable expansion operators.

 + Give objects reference count fields instead of
   slot hackiness.

 + Prototype multiplexing (multiple inheritance).







LATER:
  + Concurrency!!!
