NOW:

 + Screw boolean type.

 + Instead of Runtime_cloneField, reference builtins statically

 + Scrap builtin printer
 
 + Update control structures to use numbers rather than booleans.



MAJOR:

 + Design and implement standard library.

 + Make Runtime_rawObject return objects of common descent

 + Consolidate memory using a hybrid free list instead of
   fragmented malloc calls all over the place. Capitalize
   on repeat object sizes.




MEDIUM:

 + Handle exception catch cleanups.
 
 + Replace slot system with legit accessor.

 + Implement macros




MINOR:

 + Improve internal module code scanner. Use regex
   or something.




MAYBE:
 
 + Make carrots variable expansion operators.

 + Give objects reference count fields instead of
   slot hackiness.

 + Prototype multiplexing (multiple inheritance).




LATER:
  + Concurrency!!!
