BUG:

 + Closure scope prototype (internal->context) is being
   collected prematurely.

 + Seems that the collection, when running fizzbuzz, 
   fails during Number:clone.

 + Problem is that collectOne functions 



MAJOR:

 + Design and implement standard library.

 + Make Runtime_rawObject return objects of common descent

 + Consolidate memory using a hybrid free list instead of
   fragmented malloc calls all over the place. Capitalize
   on repeat object sizes.




MEDIUM:

 + Handle exception catch cleanups.
 
 + Replace slot system with legit accessor.

 + Implement macros




MINOR:

 + Improve internal module code scanner. Use regex
   or something.




MAYBE:
 
 + Make carrots variable expansion operators.

 + Give objects reference count fields instead of
   slot hackiness.

 + Prototype multiplexing (multiple inheritance).




LATER:
  + Concurrency!!!
