NOW:

 + Instead of Runtime_cloneField, reference builtins statically
   with Runtime_getBaseNumber, Runtime_getNumber, and et cetera.
 
 + Have Runtime_callMethod check for methods and throw exceptions
   if necessary. Don't bother checking before hand when possible.

 + Handle return value register and stuff. fuuuuuuck

 + make File type activatable (def to write)

 + Make address type



MAJOR:

 + Design and implement standard library.

 + Consolidate memory using a hybrid free list instead of
   fragmented malloc calls all over the place. Capitalize
   on repeat object sizes.




MEDIUM:

 + Handle exception catch cleanups.
 
 + Replace slot system with legit accessor.

 + Implement macros




MINOR:

 + Improve internal module code scanner. Use regex
   or something.




MAYBE:
 
 + Make carrots variable expansion operators.

 + Give objects reference count fields instead of
   slot hackiness.

 + Prototype multiplexing (multiple inheritance).




LATER:
  + Concurrency!!!
