SCHEDULED:

 + Figure out build system for internal modules (i.e. how they
   are linked with runtime files).

 + Move many files in builtins directory to standard libraries
   which may be imported.

 + Make throw command.




DEFINITELY:

	Minor:
	  + Make it so dlclose is called by module context destructors
	  + Improve error reporting.



MAYBE:
  + make carrots variable expansion operators
  + give objects reference count fields (instead of slots)



AT SOME POINT:
 + Make it so blocks with one statement don't need parens
 + Implement vector slicing
 + TODO: check return codes on builtin calls
 + Make number and string methods search for toNumber and
   toString methods instead of rejecting other types.
 + Make printer look for toString methods.
 + Replace slot system with legit accessor.
 + Check for mismatched grouping operators and such
 + Finish builtins: (1) hashmap



LATER:
  + Concurrency!!!
