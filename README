Overview

    Imp is a little scripting language I'm working on for fun
    and nothing more. It is prototype-based, duck-typed, and 
    excessively parenthesized.




Special Slots

    Fields prefixed with an underscore are considered 'special'
    and should be handled with care (if at all). These include
    the following:

      +  _prototype
      +  _cleanup
      +  _activate




Internal Slots

    A double underscore prefix is indicative of internal data, 
    which is especially special and required by built-in or 
    library-provided data structures. Avoid mucking with these
    unless you absolutely must (or are curious).

    Commonly slots for housing internals include:

      +  __data
      +  __init
      +  __cleanup
      +  __activate




Object Activation

    The process of object activation, whether in a function call
    or macro expansion, is as follows:

      1. If object has an '_activate' field of built-in type 
         closure, said closure is executed in the object's scope
         and with its arguments.

      2. If object has an '__activate' (double underscore)
         internal field, it is assumed that this field points to
         a C function, which is executed with the arguments: (1)
         runtime, (2) context, (3) calling object, (4) argc, and
         (5) argv.

      3. An error is thrown. Object cannot be activated.
