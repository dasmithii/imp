Overview

    This file will guide you in acclimating to the imp
    codebase and contribution process. 



Rules

    1. Never commit to master. Instead, use a branch named
       named after your bugfix/improvement/feature.

    2. Before submitting a pull request, ensure that 
       your changes do not cause tests to fail.

    3. Write nice, readable code with documentation where 
       necessary and not elsewhere (self-documenting code
       is ideal).



Directory Structure

    /bin and /build store compiler output.

    /core houses the standard library, a mix of .c and .imp
    files.

    /examples showcases solutions to popular programming
    problems. These are meant to introduce passersby to imp,
    teach the basics, and prove that the language itself is
    competent.

    /interpreter contains all C code responsible for the imp
    command line tool. Subdirectories:

        /imp/builtin is like /core (in that it consists of 
        both .c and .imp files) but contains only critical
        modules required by the interpreter.

        /interpreter/imp/toolbox is a collection of data
        structures and algorithms written in C.
