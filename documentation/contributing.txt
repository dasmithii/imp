Directory Structure

    /bin and /build catch compiler outputs.

    /core holds the standard library, a mix of .c and .imp
    files.

    /examples displays solutions to popular programming
    rights of passage. These are meant to introduce passersby
    to imp, teach the basics, and prove that the language is
    competent.

    /interpreter contains all C code responsible for the imp
    command line tool. Subdirectories:

        /imp/builtin is like /core but with only absolutely
        essential modules required by the interpreter.

        /interpreter/imp/toolbox is a collection of data
        structures and algorithms written in C.
