Anecdote (name explanation)

    The imp is a mischievous child of sorts, driven by an
    intense curiosity which renders both learning and pain
    inevitable.

    The imp covers ground in jumpy strides, recklessly,
    utilizing neither hindsight nor foresight. Chaos 
    follows in his wake. He is not aware of this chaos,
    though, being so perpetually enthused by what lies in
    front of his face. That which escapes the imp's field
    of vision might as well not exist. And so he sprints
    effectively with his eyes closed until a metaphorical
    wall intervenes.

    Bricks are impervious to the imp's ways, as he learns
    (and feels). The imp wallows in regret (and pain).

    Rising from rubble while still intact, the imp begins
    a new life. Dust clears, injuries heal, and he grows
    more self-aware He understands, over time, how
    "close enough" only applies to horseshoes and 
    hand-grenades. Because walls are equivalent to neither
    horseshoes nor hand-grenades, his collision meant
    little in the larger scheme of things.

    The imp had skirted death, just barely. And now he was
    free. He had escaped with many lifetimes worth of
    experiential capital.



    Also, IMP is a self-describing acronym: "I Make Programs"
