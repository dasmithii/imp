OVERVIEW

    Imp is a little scripting language I'm building for fun. It 
    is dynamic, duck-typed, and focused on prototypal programming.

      >  (import 'core/io')
      >  (io:writeLine 'Hello, world!')




TUTORIAL

    Above, we import the standard 'io' module and call its 
    'writeLine' function on a string. Resulting is an instance of
    software's greatest clichÃ©.

    The following produces identical output:

      >  (def sayHello {io:writeLine 'Hello, World!'})
      >  (sayHello)

    As would:

      >  (def sayHello {(io:writeLine 'Hello, World!')})
      >  (sayHello)

    This is because, in imp, curly braces define code blocks, and
    because the first code block contains only one statement, 
    parenthesis are implied. 


                       Object Literals

    Arbitrary objects are constructed by surrounding key-value
    pairs with hard brackets:

      >  (def someObject [
             field1 'I am a field.'
             field2 'No you are not!'
             field3 'Shut it, you two.'
         ])

    Note that nesting is allowed:

      >  (def anotherObject [
             nestedObject [
                 field 'I am a field'
             ]
         ])



                      The Object System

    Imp is dynamic and duck-typed. There are no compile-time
    distinctions between objects, which contain arbitrary
    string keys that map to nested objects (except in the case
    of built-in data).

    Object fields are accessible via the colon operator and are
    most conveniently managed with the built-in 'def', 'set', 
    and 'rem' functions. 'rem' is rarely necessary, though.

      >  (def a 2)
      >  (set a 3)
      >  (rem a)

      >  (def myObject:mySlot 'hello')
      >  (rem myObject)

    Exceptions are thrown when code attempts to access fields
    and methods that do not exist. For example:

      >  (def myObject [])         # Create new object.
      >  (myObject:nonExistentMethod) # Error!

    Methods are defined and called as follows:

      >  (def myObject [greeting 'Hi,'])
      >  (def myObject:greet {
            (io:writeLine self:greeting (@:get 0) '!')
         })
      >  (myObject:greet)

    The 'self' variable is injected into scope. Likewise is the
    '@' arguments variable, an array of arbitrary length.

    The symbols '#' and '~' stand for "base object" and
    "clone", respectively. The former contains all sorts of
    functions built in to the Imp interpreter. And the latter
    is a primitive operation in prototype-oriented programming.
    You will see it often.

    A select few symbols are used to represent common operations.
    Besides '#' and '~', there is '$', for example, which can be 
    read as "value" or "copy", and because all Imp objects are 
    reference types, (obj:$) is often necessary.




INSTALLATION

      >  git clone git@github.com:dasmithii/imp.git
      >  cd imp
      >  make release
      >  make install

    `imp` will now be available on your command line.




Etymology 

    The word "imp" is defined as "a mischievous child" and 
    doubles as the acronym: I Make Programs. It is also a 
    substring of "simple". That's the best I could do.
